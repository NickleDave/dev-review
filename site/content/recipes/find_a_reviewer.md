# Objective

Upon completing this recipe, you as the _code author_ will have found someone
suitable to perform the role of _reviewer_ in the code review.

# Steps

1. Identify the top areas to search for candidate reviewers.
  - Your research group
  - Research Software Engineer (RSE) group at your institution
  - Language or library specific groups at your institution
  - Open source or research communities you contribute to
  - Others?
  - Last resort is to throw it up on Code Review Stack Exchange
    <https://codereview.stackexchange.com/>
2. Pre-screen candidates based on your existing knowledge and some criteria
   (below).
3. Contact candidates directly or make advertisement.
4. Repeat 1 to 3 until you get a bite.
5. Confirm candidate can fulfill minimum thresholds.

# Description

<!--
Rough Outline (not visible in document)

- role and value of the reviewer
  - Does the suitability of the code reviewer determine the "value" of the code
    review?
- Finding someone to review your code is one of the more difficult parts of
  code review. Lots of preconceptions about what experience a reviewer should
have. "Don't they need to be a professional programmer to tell me anything
helpful to do with my code?"
- Headline message: nearly anyone can be a good code reviewer
- that being said, there are some threshold criteria that a reviewer should
  satisfy to make the code review as valuable as possible for both parties,
and there are some places to look that will have a higher chance of yielding a
suitable reviewer. Let's look at those now.

1. Identify the top areas to search for candidate reviewers.
  - Your research group
  - Research Software Engineer (RSE) group at your institution
  - Language or library specific groups at your institution
  - Open source or research communities you contribute to
  - Others?
  - Last resort is to throw it up on Code Review Stack Exchange
    <https://codereview.stackexchange.com/>

2. Pre-screen candidates based on your existing knowledge and some criteria
  - Criteria
    - some level of experience with the programming language you are using
      - they don't need to be experts, but they shouldn't be absolute beginners
      - code review is an opportunity to learn _more_ about a language, not
        learn the language
    - domain knowledge is desirable but not essential
      - it will help the reviewer more quickly grasp the context and what your
        code is doing, but this isn't really the purpose of the code review,
        and researchers outside your field can more than adequately fulfill the
	role of reviewer
    - if you extensively use domain-specific or advanced libraries, a reviewer
      with some experience of these libraries is probably a good idea
 
3. Contact candidates directly or make advertisement.
  - writing an email/message shouldn't be too long or difficult 
  - there might be some awkwardness or difficulties with tone especially if the
    reviewer is more senior than you
  - a casual and less formal feel for the code review is desirable, so if you
    find yourself writing a really formal email/message, then perhaps the
    person you have selected isn't a great fit
  - give some context about _why_ you are asking (link to our section about
    motivations for doing a code review)
  - list your criteria to avoid any awkward conversations down the line if they
      turn out not to be suitable
  - point them to this website if they want more information 
  - give them an idea about time commitment: (what is our estimate for this???)

4. Repeat 1 to 3 until you get a bite.
5. Confirm candidate can fulfill minimum thresholds.
  - this should have been handled in step 3, but remind yourself of the
      criteria and whether the candidate does indeed fulfill them (and also
      in case they might have missed them from your initial message)
  - other than the language criteria, the others should not be seen as deal
      breakers, unless you have a domain-specific or library-specific
      feature you need to have reviewed and think it will be essential for the
      reviewer to have experience in these areas

It might seem strange, but code review has something in common with partner
dancing: it takes two to tango. Without a reviewer, the code review cannot
happen.
