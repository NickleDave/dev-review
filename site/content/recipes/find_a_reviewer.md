# Objective

Upon completing this recipe, you as the _code author_ will have found someone
suitable to perform the role of _reviewer_ in the code review.

# Steps

1. Identify the top areas to search for candidate reviewers.
  - Your research group
  - Research Software Engineer (RSE) group at your institution
  - Language or library specific groups at your institution
  - Open source or research communities you contribute to
  - Others?
  - Last resort is to throw it up on Code Review Stack Exchange
    <https://codereview.stackexchange.com/>
2. Pre-screen candidates based on your existing knowledge and some criteria
   (below).
3. Contact candidates directly or make advertisement.
4. Repeat 1 to 3 until you get a bite.
5. Confirm candidate can fulfill minimum thresholds.

# Description

<!--
Rough Outline (not visible in document)

- role and value of the reviewer
  - Does the suitability of the code reviewer determine the "value" of the code
    review?
- Finding someone to review your code is one of the more difficult parts of
  code review. Lots of preconceptions about what experience a reviewer should
have. "Don't they need to be a professional programmer to tell me anything
helpful to do with my code?"
- Headline message: nearly anyone can be a good code reviewer
- that being said, there are some threshold criteria that a reviewer should
  satisfy to make the code review as valuable as possible for both parties,
and there are some places to look that will have a higher chance of yielding a
suitable reviewer. Let's look at those now.

1. Identify the top areas to search for candidate reviewers.
  - Your research group
  - Research Software Engineer (RSE) group at your institution
  - Language or library specific groups at your institution
  - Open source or research communities you contribute to
  - Others?
  - Last resort is to throw it up on Code Review Stack Exchange
    <https://codereview.stackexchange.com/>

2. Pre-screen candidates based on your existing knowledge and some criteria
  - Criteria
    - some level of experience with the programming language you are using
      - they don't need to be experts, but they shouldn't be absolute beginners
      - code review is an opportunity to learn _more_ about a language, not
        learn the language
    - domain knowledge is desirable but not essential
      - it will help the reviewer more quickly grasp the context and what your
        code is doing, but this isn't really the purpose of the code review,
        and researchers outside your field can more than adequately fulfill the
	role of reviewer
    - if you extensively use domain-specific or advanced libraries, a reviewer
      with some experience of these libraries is probably a good idea
 
3. Contact candidates directly or make advertisement.
  - writing an email/message shouldn't be too long or difficult 
  - there might be some awkwardness or difficulties with tone especially if the
    reviewer is more senior than you
  - a casual and less formal feel for the code review is desirable, so if you
    find yourself writing a really formal email/message, then perhaps the
    person you have selected isn't a great fit
  - give some context about _why_ you are asking (link to our section about
    motivations for doing a code review)
  - list your criteria to avoid any awkward conversations down the line if they
      turn out not to be suitable
  - point them to this website if they want more information 
  - give them an idea about time commitment: (what is our estimate for this???)

4. Repeat 1 to 3 until you get a bite.
5. Confirm candidate can fulfill minimum thresholds.
  - this should have been handled in step 3, but remind yourself of the
      criteria and whether the candidate does indeed fulfill them (and also
      in case they might have missed them from your initial message)
  - other than the language criteria, the others should not be seen as deal
      breakers, unless you have a domain-specific or library-specific
      feature you need to have reviewed and think it will be essential for the
      reviewer to have experience in these areas

It might seem strange, but code review has something in common with partner
dancing: it takes two to tango and (at least) two to review code. Without a
reviewer, the code review cannot happen. And just as a good dance partner is
essential for a well-performed routine, a suitable reviewer ensures that the
code review will be a rewarding and valuable experience. Finding someone to
fill this important role can be one of the more difficult steps in getting a
code review off the ground â€” or dancefloor, depending on how far you want the
analogy to go.

Perhaps the main barrier to finding a reviewer is misconceptions about what
experience a reviewer should possess. As a lone coder, you might be thinking,
"Only software developers do code review, so I should probably find someone
outside of research." Or "The reviewer definitely needs to be more experienced
than me." We want to be absolutely clear on this point: almost _any_ researcher
who codes can be a good reviewer of your research code.

That being said, there are certainly minimum criteria that a reviewer should
satisfy to make a code review worthwhile for both parties, and there are some
places to search for reviewers that have a higher chance of yielding someone
that fulfills these criteria. Let's look at these now.

## Step 1: Places to Look {#search}

When looking for a reviewer, your first port of call should almost always be
your own research group. Your colleagues are the most likely to be using the
same language and libraries as you, and they will be familiar with your
common research domain. It will be least intimidating to ask someone at the
same seniority level as you, but equally, you shouldn't feel ashamed or
intimidated to show your code to someone at a higher seniority. You already
show them your scientific results after all! However, there are many reasons
why it may not be possible to seek a reviewer in your research group. Your
group might be small and you are the only coder, or perhaps the idea of
reviewing code is perceived as a waste of time by your colleagues, and you are
hesitant to stick your neck out. If so, keep reading.

There are many other places to look for code reviewers. If you are fortunate
enough to have a Research Software Engineering (RSE) group at your institution,
then any member of that team would make a great reviewer for your code.
These groups have many different ways of operating, so you will need to contact
them to find out how to set up a code review. Forewarning: it is likely the
time of the RSE will need to be covered under someone's budget, so if you were
hesitant to have the conversation about code review in your research group,
that problem will probably resurface here.

Another great place to search within your institution or region are language or
library-specific community groups (e.g. a Python or R User Group). This can
help ensure the reviewer has experience with the same or similar tools you use.
Before [making your advertisement](#contact), consider asking one of the
community managers or someone you know in the community whether code review is
something that has been done before or others might be interested in. Just as
in the case with colleagues, you will be relying on people to volunteer their
time, and as you are probably all to familiar with, researchers have that in
very short supply. The community simply might not have the bandwidth to take on
code review.

It might be necessary to venture outside of your institution or immediate
geographic region to find a reviewer, and it is an increasingly viable option
in the context of remote working and many people getting used to asynchronous
communication. If you are part of a research organisation, community, or
working group that spans institutions and countries, this could be a viable
avenue to search for a reviewer. Your connections in these areas might not
themselves be suitable, but you can ask if they know anyone who might be.
Open source or open science communities could similarly be leveraged,
especially if you intend to make your software open source. If you have
extended an open source library or even just made some convenient scripts to
work with it, consider opening a merge/pull request to get the maintainers to
have a look. A good example of this for more mature software is [rOpenSci's
peer review initiative](https://bssw.io/blog_posts/a-community-of-practice-around-peer-review-for-long-term-research-software-sustainability).

If none of the above options bear any fruit, then as a last resort you could
make a post on the [Code Review Stack
Exchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/). See the ["What questions can
I ask about here?"](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) page to
see whether it could suit your needs.

## Step 2: Criteria for Screening {#criteria}

Once you have identified a potential reviewer and before you contant them, you
should consider whether they will satisfy some minimum thresholds to be a
suitable reviewer. 

1. Do they have some level of experience with the programming language(s) of
   your code? They do not need to be experts in the language(s), but they
   should not be absolute beginners. Code review is an opportunity to learn
   _more_ about a programming language, not to learn the language itself. 
2. Do they have some degree of knowledge about your research domain? This is
   not strictly necessary, but can be desirable. Domain knowledge will help
   your reviewer more quickly grasp the context of what your code is doing and
   therefore address the code itself more directly. Researchers or developers
   outside your domain can certainly offer valuable insight, but it might just
   take a bit longer. We are all for cross-disciplinary interactions.
3. Are they familiar with the libraries or tools that you use? As for the
   previous criterion, this one isn't strictly necessary, but it can have quite
   a large impact upon the value of the review. The importance of this
   criterion scales with the extent to which your code relies on another
   library or tool and how essential it is to the functionality of your code.
