<h1 id="description">Description</h1>
<p>It might seem strange, but code review has something in common with partner
dancing: it takes two to tango and (at least) two to review code. Without a
reviewer, the code review cannot happen. And just as a good dance partner is
essential for a well-performed routine, a suitable reviewer ensures that the
code review will be a rewarding and valuable experience. Finding someone to
fill this important role can be one of the more difficult steps in getting a
code review off the ground â€” or dance floor, depending on how far you want the
analogy to go.</p>
<p>The good news is, almost any researcher who codes is a good candidate for being a
reviewer. Particularly, the belief that only software development experts
should review code is an unfortunate misconception.
That being said, there are certainly minimum criteria that a reviewer should
satisfy to make a code review worthwhile for both parties, and there are some
places to search for reviewers that have a higher chance of yielding someone
that fulfills these criteria. Let&rsquo;s look at these now.</p>
<h2 id="search">Step 1: Places to Look</h2>
<p>When looking for a reviewer, your first port of call should almost always be
your own research group. Your colleagues are the most likely to be using the
same language and libraries as you, and they will be familiar with your
common research domain. It will be least intimidating to ask someone at the
same seniority level as you, but equally, you shouldn&rsquo;t feel ashamed or
intimidated to show your code to someone at a higher seniority. You already
show them your scientific results after all! However, there are many reasons
why it may not be possible to seek a reviewer in your research group. Your
group might be small and you are the only coder, or perhaps the idea of
reviewing code is perceived as a waste of time by your colleagues, and you are
hesitant to stick your neck out. If so, keep reading.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO Add link to our advice about encouraging code review in a research group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many other places to look for code reviewers.  Indeed, it can actually
be beneficial to get reviewers from outside your research group. They can
challenge implicit and shaky assumptions in your code that only someone with
fresh eyes and less expertise might raise. Moreover, they tend to be more
impartial.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you are fortunate enough to have a Research Software Engineering
(RSE) group at your institution, then any member of that team would make a great
reviewer for your code. These groups have many different ways of operating, so
you will need to contact them to find out how to set up a code review.
Forewarning: it is likely the time of the RSE will need to be covered under
someone&rsquo;s budget, so if you were hesitant to have the conversation about code
review in your research group, that problem will probably resurface here.</p>
<p>Another great place to search within your institution or region are language or
library-specific community groups (e.g. a Python or R User Group). This can
help ensure the reviewer has experience with the same or similar tools you use.
Before <a href="#contact" rel="">making your advertisement</a>, consider asking one of the
community managers or someone you know in the community whether code review is
something that has been done before or others might be interested in. Just as
in the case with colleagues, you will be relying on people to volunteer their
time, and as you are probably all to familiar with, researchers have that in
very short supply. The community simply might not have the bandwidth to take on
code review.</p>
<p>It might be necessary to venture outside of your institution or immediate
geographic region to find a reviewer, and it is an increasingly viable option
in the context of remote working and many people getting used to asynchronous
communication. If you are part of a research organisation, community, or
working group that spans institutions and countries, this could be a viable
avenue to search for a reviewer. Your connections in these areas might not
themselves be suitable, but you can ask if they know anyone who might be.
Open source or open science communities could similarly be leveraged,
especially if you intend to make your software open source. If you have
extended an open source library or even just made some convenient scripts to
work with it, consider opening a merge/pull request to get the maintainers to
have a look. A good example of this for more mature software is <a href="https://bssw.io/blog_posts/a-community-of-practice-around-peer-review-for-long-term-research-software-sustainability" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">rOpenSci&rsquo;s
peer review initiative</a> and the analogue for Python, <a href="https://www.pyopensci.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">pyOpenSci</a>.</p>
<p>If none of the above options bear any fruit, then as a last resort you could
make a post on the <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Code Review Stack
Exchange</a>. See the <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">&ldquo;What questions can I
ask about here?&quot;</a> page to
determine whether it could suit your needs. Anecdotally, StackExchange sites can yield harsh criticism and are not always the most warm or welcoming places. Consider whether you want to open yourself up to that before posting.</p>

<h2 id="criteria">Step 2: Criteria for Screening</h2>
<p>Before contacting a potential reviewer, consider whether they are a good fit to
the code being reviewed. Ideally, a reviewer will have some experience in the
programming language your code uses, in the external libraries or frameworks
used, and in the problem domain. However, the relative weight of these criteria
will depend upon your personal objectives for the review, so they are not hard
and fast. For example, if your main concern is readability, then a reviewer will
only require familiarity with the programming language, and specific frameworks
will matter less. These considerations equally apply to selecting a group or
community to advertsie in.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ol>
<li>Do they have some level of experience with the programming language(s) of
your code? They do not need to be experts in the language(s), but they
should not be absolute beginners. Code review is an opportunity to learn
<em>more</em> about a programming language, not to learn the language itself.</li>
<li>Do they have some degree of knowledge about your research domain? This is
not strictly necessary, but can be desirable. Domain knowledge will help
your reviewer more quickly grasp the context of what your code is doing and
therefore address the code itself more directly. Researchers or developers
outside your domain can certainly offer valuable insight, but it might just
take a bit longer. We are all for cross-disciplinary interactions.</li>
<li>Are they familiar with the libraries or tools that you use? As for the
previous criterion, this one isn&rsquo;t strictly necessary, but it can have quite
a large impact upon the value of the review. The importance of this
criterion scales with the extent to which your code relies on another
library or tool and how essential it is to the functionality of your code.</li>
</ol>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="contact">Step 3: Contact candidate or advertise</h2>
<p>Everyone has their own way of writing messages, and we don&rsquo;t want to be too
prescriptive about how you reach out to a potential reviewer. If you already
know the reviewer, this step should be straightforward, but if not, then it can
be a little stressful going out on a limb to contact someone you don&rsquo;t know or
advertise to a group of people, especially if they are more senior than you.
Our advice: don&rsquo;t overthink it, and stay concise and to the point. A casual and
less formal atmosphere for the code review is desirable, so if you find
yourself writing a stilted and overly-formal message to a candidate, then it
might be worth thinking whether it will be a good fit.</p>
<p>Consider including the following information in any message or advertisement
you compose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Context about <em>why</em> you are looking to have your code reviewed. The
motivations section (<strong>TODO</strong> add link) on this website might be helpful to
identify the reasons that motivated you to get your code reviewed.</li>
<li>A brief summary of what your code does and any particular aspects you want
addressed.</li>
<li><a href="#criteria" rel="">Any of the criteria for a suitable reviewer</a> that you weren&rsquo;t
able to answer yourself before reaching out.</li>
<li>An idea of the time commitment (<strong>TODO</strong> what is our estimate for how long the
whole process will take?)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="repeat">Step 4: Rinse and Repeat</h2>
<p>Loop through steps 1 to 3 until you get a bite. Once you have your reviewer,
proceed to the <a href="meet_and_agree_on_objectives" rel="">next step</a> and arrange a meeting
to agree on objectives for the review.</p>
