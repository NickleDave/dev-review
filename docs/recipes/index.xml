      <description>lone coder Context: Both author and reviewer are lone coders with no previous experience in code review.
Both authors and reviewers work within the same group or same lab. They work on different projects but are both familiar with the scientific field.

Finding a reviewer: Anyone can review code, even if they are not a proficient coder/software engineer. However, in a group or lab, it may be possible to pair a more experienced author or reviewer with a less experienced author or reviewer.</description>
