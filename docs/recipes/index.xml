      <description>Lone Coder Context: Both author and reviewer are lone coders with no previous experience in code review.
Both authors and reviewers work within the same group or same lab. They work on different projects but are both familiar with the scientific field.
Nomenclature: R = reviewer, A = author
Finding a reviewer: Anyone can review code, even if they are not a proficient coder/software engineer. However, in a group or lab, it may be possible to pair a more experienced author or reviewer with a less experienced author or reviewer.</description>

      <description>Perform code review Code author communicates code and context The first step initiating the actual code review phase is for the code author to select a segment of their code to be reviewed. The success and impact of the code review will depend, to some degree, on how appropriate the selected segment is, so it warrants some consideration from the code author. Here are some points to keep in mind when selecting your code segment.</description>
